abstract="An algebraic presentation of Martin-L{\"o}f's intuitionistic type theory is given which is based on the notion of a category with families with extra structure. We then present a type-checking algorithm for the normal forms of this theory, and sketch how it gives rise to an initial category with families with extra structure. In this way we obtain a purely algebraic formulation of the correctness of the type-checking algorithm which provides the core of proof assistants for intuitionistic type theory.",
