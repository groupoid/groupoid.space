abstract="When formalizing category theory in traditional set-theoretic foundations, a significant discrepancy between the foundational notion of ``sameness'' -- equality -- and its practical use arises: most category-theoretic concepts are invariant under weaker notions of sameness than equality, namely isomorphism in a category or equivalence of categories. We show that this discrepancy can be avoided when formalizing category theory in Univalent Foundations.",
