Groupoid Infinity is a group of mathematicians who develop
the cubical base library to all main cubical type checkers
(cubicaltt, Arend, Agda, Lean), the home page of the project
is <a href="https://cubical.systems">cubical.systems</a>.</p><p>The main aim is to provide formal HoTT foundations for contemporary
math and have fun. Some parts are so new that we need a help of
strong mathematicians. Our areas of interests are: Sheaf Theory,
Infinity Category Theory, Differential Geometry, Cohesive Type
Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Homology, and Cohomology Theory,
Geometric Type Theory. Our community is mostly guided by
outdated [Russian literature] <a href="https://instagram.com/groupoid.space">instagram.com/groupoid.space</a>.</p><p>Our proposal is following. We want to provide $400/month budged
to volunteers helping us clarify topics that are not yet
presented at ncatlab or topics that need to be clarified
in the direction of our interests. We are talking about the very
foundations, not the Fields Medal caliber. E.g. we lack de
Rham cohomology based formal foundation of classical calculus,
for the first year graduate students. But you can pick any
topic from our area of interests.</p><p>Your responsibility will be to provide coverage of necessary
math foundations contributed to ncatlab, so we can grab this information and
formalize it in cubical type checkers. Please consider this as
an art project, despite the cutting edge mathematics we are
dealing with. Our main motivation is to spread contemporary
math around the world and to help students who want to deal
with cubical type checkers. As a side effect, we are expecting
you to have fun as we do along the way.</p><p>Best regards<br>
