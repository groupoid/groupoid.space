                    Pi calculus can be transformed from lambda
                    calculus by replacing a variable constructor with stream constructor.
                    But the language and protocol for accessing this stream can vary
                    for different backends with respect to design requirements.
                p.
                    Stream calculus provides different disciplines for accessing
                    underlying streams used in Pi calculus. For example: 1) linear types, or streams with
                    constant direction without rollbacks, where each element of the stream is accessed once;
                    2) random access arrays; 3) GPU sources; 4) runtime typed channels;
                    5) effect and coeffect streams (processes as streams). Such stream
                    calculuses could be possible in GPU languages (e.g. Futhark)
                    and AVX intrinsics languages (e.g. Julia). We could treat
                    stream calculus as memory representation with different access protocols.
                p.
                    One type of disciplines is stream calculus. While Pi calculus could be viewed as
                    lambda calculus where function arguments are channels or streams, stream calculus defines set
                    of constructions over these streams. This calculus is needed to provide different forms
                    of vectorization that can be used on GPU and AVX hardware.
