\begin{abstract}
CW-complexes are fundamental objects in homotopy type theory
and even included inside cubical type checker in a form of
higher (co)-inductive types (HITs).
Just like regular (co)-inductive types could be described as recursive
terminating (well-founded) or non-terminating trees,
higher inductive types could be described as CW-complexes.
Defining HIT means to define some CW-complex
directly using cubical homogeneous composition structure as an
element of initial algebra inside cubical model.

\section{Prerequisites}

\subsection{ETCS}
Lawvere’s theory ETCS (Lawvere 2005) has eight axioms:
(L1) finite roots exist,
(L2) the exponential of any pair of objects exist,
(L3) there is a Dedekind-Peano object,
(L4) the terminal object is separating,
(L5) axiom of choice,
(L6) every object not isomorphic to an initial object contains an element,
(L7) Each element of a sum is a member of one of its injections,
(L8) there is an object with more than one element.
